1.  Introduction

   DetNet (Deterministic Networking) provides a capability to carry
   specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
   with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end

   delivery latency.  A description of the general background and
   concepts of DetNet can be found in [RFC8655].

   This document defines a YANG model for DetNet based on YANG data
   types and modeling language defined in [RFC6991] and [RFC7950].
   DetNet service, which is designed for describing the characteristics
   of services being provided for application flows over a network, and
   DetNet configuration, which is designed for DetNet flow path
   establishment, flow status reporting, and DetNet functions
   configuration in order to achieve end-to-end bounded latency and zero
   congestion loss, are both included in this document.

2.  Terminologies

   This documents uses the terminologies defined in [RFC8655].

3.  DetNet Configuration Module

   DetNet configuration module includes DetNet App-flow configuration,
   DetNet Service Sub-layer configuration, and DetNet Forwarding Sub-
   layer configuration.  The corresponding attributes used in different
   sub-layers are defined in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 respectively.

3.1.  DetNet Appliction Flow Configuration Attributes

   DetNet application flow is responsible for mapping between
   application flows and DetNet flows at the edge node(egress/ingress
   node).  Where the application flows can be either layer 2 or layer 3
   flows.  To map a flow at the User Network Interface (UNI), the
   corresponding attributes are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model].

3.2.  DetNet Service Sub-layer Configuration Attributes

   DetNet service functions, e.g., DetNet tunnel initialization/
   termination and service protection, are provided in DetNet service
   sub-layer.  To support these functions, the following service
   attributes need to be configured:

   o  DetNet flow identification

   o  Service function indication, indicates which service function will
      be invoked at a DetNet edge, relay node or end station.  (DetNet
      tunnel initialization or termination are default functions in
      DetNet service layer, so there is no need for explicit
      indication).  The corresponding arguments for service functions
      also needs to be defined.

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-detnet-yang-10-working-version   January 2021


3.3.  DetNet Forwarding Sub-layer Configuration Attributes

   As defined in [RFC8655], DetNet forwarding sub-layer optionally
   provides congestion protection for DetNet flows over paths provided
   by the underlying network.  Explicit route is another mechanism that
   is used by DetNet to avoid temporary interruptions caused by the
   convergence of routing or bridging protocols, and it is also
   implemented at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.

   To support congestion protection and explicit route, the following
   transport layer related attributes are necessary:

   o  Traffic Specification, refers to Section 7.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model].  It may used for
      resource reservation, flow shaping, filtering and policing.

   o  Explicit path, existing explicit route mechanisms can be reused.
      For example, if Segment Routing (SR) tunnel is used as the
      transport tunnel, the configuration is mainly at the ingress node
      of the transport layer; if the static MPLS tunnel is used as the
      transport tunnel, the configurations need to be at every transit
      node along the path; for pure IP based transport tunnel, it's
      similar to the static MPLS case.

4.  DetNet Flow Aggregation

   DetNet provides the capability of flow aggregation to improve
   scaleability of DetNet data, management and control planes.
   Aggregated flows can be viewed by the some DetNet nodes as individual
   DetNet flows.  When aggregating DetNet flows, the flows should be
   compatible: if bandwidth reservations are used, the reservation
   should be a reasonable representation of the individual reservations;
   if maximum delay bounds are used, the system should ensure that the
   aggregate does not exceed the delay bounds of the individual flows.

   The DetNet YANG model defined in this document supports DetNet flow
   aggregation with the following functions:

   o  Aggregation flow encapsulation/decapsulation/identification

   o  Mapping individual DetNet flows to an aggregated flow

   o  Changing traffic specification parameters for aggregated flow

   The following cases of DetNet aggregation are supported:

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-detnet-yang-10-working-version   January 2021


   o  aggregate data flows into an application which is then mapped to a
      service sub-layer at the ingress node.  Note the data flows may be
      other DetNet flows.

   o  map each DetNet application to a single service sub-layer and
      allowing the aggregation of multiple applications at the ingress
      node, and vice versa for de-aggregation.  A classifier may be
      required to de-aggregate the respective applications.

   o  map each DetNet application uniquely to a single service sub-layer
      where those sub-layers may be encapsulated as a single service
      sub-layer and hence aggregating the applications at the ingress
      node, and vice versa for de-aggregation.  In this case, the
      service sub-layer identifier may be sufficient to identify the
      application.  A classifier may be required to de-aggregate the
      service sub-layers.

   o  aggregate DetNet service sub-layers into an aggregated flow by
      using the same forwarding sub-layer at ingress node or relay node,
      and vice versa for de-aggregation.

   o  aggregate DetNet flows with different forwarding sub-layer into an
      aggregated flow by using the same forwarding sub-layer at transit
      node, and vice versa for de-aggregation.

   Traffic requirements and traffic specification may be tracked for
   individual or aggregate flows but reserving resources and tracking
   the services in the aggregated flow is out of scope.

5.  DetNet YANG Structure Considerations

   The picture shows that the general structure of the DetNet YANG
   Model:

                     +-----------+
                     |ietf-detnet|
                     +-----+-----+
                           |
             +-------------+---------------+
             |             |               |
       +-----+-----+ +-----+-----+ +-------+------+
       | App Flows | |service s-l| |forwarding s-l|
       +-----------+ +-----------+ +--------------+

   There are three instances in DetNet YANG Model: App-flow instance,
   service sub-layer instance and forwarding sub-layer instance,
   respectively corresponding to four parts of DetNet functions defined
   in section 3.
